Current Sensing dust collection controller

This code is an ardunio sketch for a wood working dust collector controller. It uses non-invasive current sensors to detect when tools on other electrical circuits turn on, this triggers a relay to turn on the dust collector. A scavenged RC radio from a remote control light switch was used as additional method of turning on the dust collector.
